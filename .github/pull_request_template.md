## Summary

Describe the user-visible change and the repository surfaces it touches.

## Linked issue or specification

- Closing keyword issue: `Closes #123` / `Fixes #123` / `Resolves #123`
- Requirement / feature IDs:

When a PR implements an issue, use a GitHub closing keyword in that same section
(`Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`, or `Resolves #123`) so the issue closes
automatically after the merge queue lands the change on `main`.

If you list requirement or feature IDs here, include the same IDs in the PR title so the squash commit headline preserves them in `git log`.

## Validation

- [ ] `scripts/ci/quality-gates.sh`
