# syu app browser UI guide

<!-- FEAT-APP-001, FEAT-DOCS-001 -->

`syu app .` serves a local browser UI for exploring your workspace specification interactively.

```bash
syu app .
# → syu app listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
# → syu app ready: http://127.0.0.1:3000
# → Open http://127.0.0.1:3000 in your browser.
# → Press Ctrl-C to stop.
```

Open the printed URL in any browser, then press `Ctrl-C` in the terminal when
you are done.

## Layout overview

The UI is divided into three areas:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header — section tabs (Philosophy | Policies | …)          │
├─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Left sidebar   │  Main content area                        │
│  • Workspace    │  • Item detail (title, links, traces)     │
│    summary      │                                           │
│  • Section      │                                           │
│    overview     ├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Document     │  Validation panel                         │
│    list         │  • Issues, rule codes, severities         │
└─────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Header — section tabs

Four tabs correspond to the four spec layers:

| Tab | What it contains |
|-----|-----------------|
| **philosophy** | Core values and design principles — the *why* |
| **policies** | Repository-wide rules that operationalise philosophy — the *how* |
| **requirements** | Specific obligations with test traces |
| **features** | Implemented capabilities with implementation traces |

Click a tab to switch the content area and the document list in the sidebar.

---

## Left sidebar

### Workspace summary panel

The top card shows the workspace root path, the spec root path, and three metrics:

- **issues** — total open validation issues
- **requirement traces** — `validated / declared` (how many declared test traces were confirmed on disk)
- **feature traces** — `validated / declared` (same for implementation traces)

### Sections panel

The four layers are shown as cards with bar charts indicating relative item counts. Click any card to jump to that section.

### Document list

Below the sections panel, the documents for the active section are listed. Click a document name to load its items in the main content area.

---

## Main content area

### Item detail

Selecting an item shows:

- **ID and title** — the stable identifier and human-readable name
- **Status badge** — `planned`, `implemented`, or `deprecated`
- **Summary / description** — the prose from the YAML
- **Links panel** — the upstream and downstream relationships (e.g. which requirements a feature satisfies; which policies a requirement enforces)
- **Traces panel** — the declared test and implementation traces, with file path and symbol name

### Clicking links

Every linked ID in the Links panel is a button. Clicking it jumps directly to that item, even if it is in a different section or document.

---

## Validation panel

The validation panel appears at the bottom of the page and lists all issues found during the last `syu validate` run that was used to generate the app data.

Each row shows:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Code** | The `SYU-[genre]-[content]-[NNN]` rule code |
| **Severity** | `error` or `warning` |
| **Subject** | The spec item ID the issue refers to (if any) |
| **Message** | A short human-readable description |

### Filtering issues

The panel header includes a severity filter. Select **errors only** to hide warnings, or **all** to see everything.

### Jumping to the affected item

Click the subject ID in any validation issue row to jump directly to that spec item in the main content area.

---

## Starting options

### Default address and port

By default `syu app` binds to `127.0.0.1:3000`. Override on the command line:

```bash
syu app . --port 8080
syu app . --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Persistent config

Set defaults in `syu.yaml` so you do not have to pass flags every time:

```yaml
app:
  bind: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3000
```

CLI flags always override the config values. See the [configuration guide](./configuration.md#appbind) for the full reference.

---

## Health checks and readiness

Once the app has loaded the workspace successfully, `GET /health` returns:

```json
{"status":"ok","version":"0.0.1-alpha.7"}
```

The startup log also prints a distinct ready line:

```text
syu app ready: http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Use that line or the `/health` endpoint in CI scripts, container probes, or
process supervisors instead of a fixed `sleep`.

---

## Refreshing the data

The browser UI polls the `syu app` server's `/api/version` endpoint about every
two seconds to detect spec snapshot changes. When a YAML file under the spec
root changes, the browser reloads the workspace data without requiring a server
restart.

The refresh banner appears briefly while the UI swaps in the new snapshot.

Two caveats still matter:

1. The browser keeps your current deep link when possible, but if the selected
   item disappears you may land on the first available item in that section.
2. Changes outside the spec snapshot flow, such as app server flags or
   configuration in `syu.yaml`, still require restarting `syu app`.

## What's next?

- Read the [getting-started guide](./getting-started.md) to build the spec files that this UI displays
- Follow the [tutorial](./tutorial.md) for a complete worked example
- Run `syu validate .` from the CLI for the same validation results in a terminal-friendly format
