# Trace adapter capability matrix

When you choose a `tests:` or `implementations:` language key, three validator
capabilities matter most:

- **symbol existence validation** — whether `syu validate` can confirm that the
  declared symbol is really present in the traced file
- **`doc_contains` validation** — whether `syu` can inspect symbol
  documentation comments and enforce required snippets
- **strict `validate.require_symbol_trace_coverage` inventory** — whether `syu`
  can scan the repository for unowned public APIs and tests in that language

This page summarizes the built-in trace adapters that ship with this checked-in
version of `syu`. Use it before you turn on `doc_contains` checks widely or
enable strict coverage in a mixed-language repository.

## What the strict inventory scans

When `validate.require_symbol_trace_coverage: true` is enabled, `syu` currently
builds ownership inventories for these languages only:

- **Rust** — public items in `src/`, plus `#[test]` functions in `src/` and
  `tests/`
- **Python** — public names in `src/` that do not start with `_`, plus
  `test_...` and `Test...` symbols in `tests/`
- **Go** — exported identifiers in `src/`, plus `Test...`, `Benchmark...`,
  `Fuzz...`, and `Example...` symbols in `_test.go` files
- **Java** — public classes/interfaces/enums/records plus public or implicit
  interface members in `src/`, plus JUnit `@Test` methods and legacy `test...`
  methods in `tests/`
- **C#** — public classes/interfaces/enums/records/structs plus public or
  implicit interface members in `src/`, plus xUnit/NUnit/MSTest-style test
  methods marked with attributes such as `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, `[Test]`, and
  `[TestMethod]` in `tests/`
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** — exported symbols in `src/`, plus `test...` and
  `Test...` symbols in `tests/`

Other built-in adapters still validate the traces you declare explicitly, but
they do **not** participate in the repository-wide strict ownership scan.

## How to choose the right promises

- Need `doc_contains`? Rust, Python, Go, and TypeScript / JavaScript traces all support it today.
- Need strict ownership coverage? Rust, Python, Go, Java, C#, and
  TypeScript / JavaScript all participate today.
- Using Ruby, Shell, YAML, JSON, Markdown, or Gitignore traces? Keep the mapping to
  `file` + `symbols` (or `symbols: ["*"]` when one file intentionally belongs
  to one item), but do not expect doc-comment inspection or strict ownership
  inventory.
- Want a runnable reference for that lighter mapping? Start with the
  [`examples/docs-first` workspace on GitHub](https://github.com/ugoite/syu/tree/main/examples/docs-first),
  which demonstrates a shell symbol trace, markdown-backed requirement
  evidence, and cautious wildcard YAML ownership in one small workspace.

Even in rich-inspection languages, wildcard traces cannot use `doc_contains`
because `symbols: ["*"]` does not point to one inspectable symbol.

## What about unsupported languages?

Unsupported adapters such as `kotlin` still raise `SYU-trace-language-001`.
Keep those repositories connected through the spec layers first, and only add
language-specific code traces once adapter support lands.
If you are adopting `syu` in a mixed-language repository today, use this staged
path instead of waiting for perfect adapter coverage:

1. keep the philosophy, policy, requirement, and feature documents checked in so
   the unsupported-language area is still part of the same layered spec story
2. leave `validate.require_symbol_trace_coverage: false` until the supported
   traces in the repository are stable
3. keep direct code traces only in languages that already have adapters, plus
   lightweight supporting files such as shell scripts, YAML, Markdown, or JSON
4. treat the unsupported-language implementation traces as future work and use
   `show`, `relate`, `log`, and `validate --id ...` to keep the higher-level
   design connected in the meantime

When you need a concrete fallback shape, start from the closest checked-in
example instead of inventing a migration path from scratch.
If you need a Go-first starting point today, study the
[`examples/go-only` workspace on GitHub](https://github.com/ugoite/syu/tree/main/examples/go-only)
or scaffold `syu init . --template go-only`. Both keep real Go files in the
repository while validating explicit symbol mappings, and Go traces can now add
`doc_contains` when reviewers want comment-level evidence too.
If you need a Java-first starting point today, study the
[`examples/java-only` workspace on GitHub](https://github.com/ugoite/syu/tree/main/examples/java-only)
or scaffold `syu init . --template java-only`. Both keep real Java files in the
repository while validating explicit symbol mappings, but Java traces should
still stay with `file` plus `symbols` because `doc_contains` is not supported yet.
If you need a Ruby-first starting point today, study the
[`examples/ruby-only` workspace on GitHub](https://github.com/ugoite/syu/tree/main/examples/ruby-only)
or scaffold `syu init . --template ruby-only`. Both keep real Ruby files in the
repository while validating explicit symbol mappings, but Ruby traces should
still stay with `file` plus `symbols` because `doc_contains` is not supported yet.
If you want a concrete staged C# adoption shape today, study the
[`examples/csharp-fallback` workspace on GitHub](https://github.com/ugoite/syu/tree/main/examples/csharp-fallback).
It keeps real C# files in the repository while validating supported shell and
markdown evidence around them before you decide how aggressively to trace the
rest of the C# codebase.

When the unsupported language matters enough that the staged fallback is no
longer sufficient, open a feature request with:

- the language name and the trace style you need (`symbols`, `doc_contains`,
  strict inventory coverage, or all three)
- one or two representative source snippets that show what the adapter would
  need to inspect
- the closest current fallback example you had to use instead

That gives contributors enough context to judge whether the next step should be
better documentation, a lighter adapter, or full trace support.
